    "## Merge a HED tag spreadsheet with an existing JSON sidecar.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook merges a 4-column spreadsheet into an existing BIDS JSON sidecar. This operation is used when the HED annotations are in a spreadsheet and the user wishes to incorporate the information into a BIDS JSON sidecar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spreadsheet must have the following 4 columns: `column_name`, `column_value`, `description`, and `HED`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the merge operation itself does not require any information except the spreadsheet and the sidecar, this notebook constructs a test by first extracting a JSON sidecar from the information from dataset event files and transforming it into a spreadsheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook, substitute the specifics of your BIDS\n",
    "dataset for the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable | Purpose |\n",
    "| -------- | ------- |\n",
    "| json_sidecar_path | Full path to root directory of dataset.|\n",
    "| spreadsheet_path | List of directories to exclude when constructing file lists. |\n",
    "| skip_columns  | List of columns in the `events.tsv` files to skip. |\n",
    "| value_columns | List of columns in the `events.tsv` files to annotate as<br>as a whole rather than by individual column value. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To actually do the merge of spreadsheet into a JSON sidecar,\n",
    "you only need to have the file names of the spreadsheet and the JSON sidecar.\n",
    "\n",
    "For large datasets, you will want to be sure to exclude columns such as\n",
    "`onset` and `sample`, since the summary produces counts of the number of times\n",
    "each unique value appears somewhere in an event file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When run, the script extracts a JSON sidecar and converts it to a spreadsheet\n",
    "for illustrating the merge. To merge, the spreadsheet is converted back and then\n",
    "merged with another JSON sidecar.\n",
    "\n",
