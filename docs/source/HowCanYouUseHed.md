# How do you use HED?

HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors) annotations provide an essential link between 
experimental data and analysis.

The move towards open, reproducible science, both in the scientific community and
by funding agencies, makes data sharing a requirement.
An added benefit, is that data used by others is likely to garner increased recognition
and additional citations.

### Standardizing the format

An important aspect of data-sharing is putting your data into a standardized format
so that tools can read and manipulate the data without users having to write
special-purpose reformatting.

[**BIDS**](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) (Brain Imaging data Structure)
is a widely used data organization standard for neuroimaging data.
HED is well-integrated into the BIDS standard.

#### Learning about BIDS
- If you are unfamiliar with BIDS, we recommend starting with the
[**BIDS Start Kit**](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/index.html).
- The [**Folders and Files**](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/folders_and_files/folders.html)
gives an overview of how files are organized.
- The [**Annotating a BIDS dataset**](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/tutorials/annotation.html) tutorial gives an overview
of how to get the appropriate metadata into a BIDS dataset.
- See the [**BIDS specification**](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
for detailed information on the rules for BIDS.
Of special interest to HED users are the sections on [**Task events**](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/05-task-events.html)
and the [**Hierarchical Event Descriptors**](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendices/hed.html) appendix.
