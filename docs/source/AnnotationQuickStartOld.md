# 1. Event annotation quick start

**Note: This tutorial is in the process of being developed.** 

This tutorial takes you through the steps of annotating the events in your 
BIDS dataset using HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors) and the online tools
available at [hedtools.ucsd.edu/hed](https://hedtools.ucsd.edu/hed).

The goal is to construct a single `events.json` sidecar file located in 
the root directory of your dataset with all the annotations needed for
users to understand and analyze your data.
