# HED tagging with CTagger

This tutorial takes you through the steps of annotating the events in your BIDS dataset
using HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors).
The goal is to construct a single `events.json` file located in the root directory
of your dataset, with all the annotations needed for users to understand and
analyze your data.
