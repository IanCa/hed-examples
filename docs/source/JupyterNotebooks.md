# Jupyter notebooks

**Note: This tutorial is in the process of being developed.** 

This tutorial works through the use of various Jupyter notebooks that use the HedTools.

* [**Annotation notebooks**](annotation-notebooks-anchor)  
* [**Validation notebooks**](validation-notebooks-anchor)   
* [**Summary notebooks**](summary-notebooks-anchor)  
* [**Dataset-specific notebooks**](dataset-specific-notebooks-anchor)  


(annotation-notebooks-anchor)=
## Annotation notebooks

These notebooks are used to assist in creating annotation templates and
other annotation activities.

(validation-notebooks-anchor)=
## Validation notebooks
 
These notebooks are used to validate BIDS event files and HED tagging.


(summary-notebooks-anchor)=
## Summary notebooks

These notebooks are used to produce JSON summaries of dataset events.

(dataset-specific-notebooks-anchor)=
## Dataset-specific notebooks

These notebooks are used to process specific datasets.
Mainly these notebooks are used for detected and correcting errors
and refactoring or reorganizing dataset events.
