## Introduction
This dataset consist of raw fMRI data, accompanied by anatomical data (T1w) for a subset of participants that were collected for a study into the reaction time of young amateur soccer players. The raw data has only undergone dicom to nii transformation.

## Experiment overview
In the experiment participants did a stop-signal task. They were presented with white arrows, and had to respond by pressing the left or right key on the button box placed in their hand. On some trials the arrow turned red, meaning that the participants had to stop their response. The participants are young amateur soccer players, who are expected to have high performance on this task. The time between the white arrow appearing and turning red is adapted in a thresholding procedure, in order to create an average performance on the stop-trials of 50%.
